### 📖 About Me
I'm a dedicated data science learner from [Your Location, e.g., Nigeria], with a knack for uncovering patterns in messy data. My journey started with [brief hook, e.g., "a fascination for how algorithms can predict trends in crypto trading"]. Outside code, I enjoy [personal touch, e.g., "hiking, reading sci-fi, and mentoring up-and-coming devs"]. I'm always up for collaborating on open-source projects—let's solve problems together!

*(Tip: Keep this 3-5 sentences. Add a fun fact to humanize it.)*

### 🛠️ Skills
Proficient in tools that power data-driven decisions. Here's my tech stack:

| Category          | Tools & Frameworks                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Programming**   | Python, R, SQL                      |
| **Data Analysis** | Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  |
| **Machine Learning** | Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch |
| **Visualization** | Tableau, Power BI, Plotly           |
| **Other**         | Git, Jupyter Notebooks, AWS Basics  |

*(Add badges for flair: e.g., ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white). List 8-12 skills max—focus on data science strengths from your repos.)*

### 🎓 Education
